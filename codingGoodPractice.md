## Data Model
Model struct name should always be suffixed with *Model*

## Functions
- functions should always start with lower case character
- functions names should be in camelcase

## Fields in proto struct and proto generated Objects 
- Those fields start always with a upper case character

## Fields in Data Model struct
- The fields always start with an upper case character


## Proto Object
- I am thinking that we should suffix all the proto object with Proto TODO
